So I just finished my second project. A Sinatra based MVC web application.

The subject of this project is a kind of virtual album to show off a user's collection of trading pins.
A user must be able to sign up, login, and logout.  They must be able to create/add a new pin to their collection via form filling. They can view their new pin when it's created. They can see their own collection and edit the pins in it or delete a pin. They can see a list of other users and their pins but cannot edit them. 

This was a tough assignment for me. Haha. They all are. But my knowledge and understanding is growing. This project challenged me. Figuring how to get my controllers working together was tough. I kept making the project harder than it needed to be. That was mostly due to not fully grasping how the controller and views work together. That and knowing how to call on specific objects with @instance_variables.methods and dynamic routes. It was quit dizzying. But, I believe, after struggling and working through it all, I understand what I did in this project and why I did it.

In the end I am proud of what I did. I wish I had and easier time with the functionality of the project. It would have afforded me more time to work on the CSS of it. It is not as pretty as I would like it. But maybe I can come back to it sometime and make it what I want it to be. 

I had plenty of times during this project that I did not think I was going to make it. Several times I thought I might quit. But, I worked through it all. I got it working. Like after spending all day working on a problem only to find that the solution was what I had started with in the beginning. That I was not wrong. It just didn't work.

Clearly, things were not as perfect as I thought but they weren't as wrong as I thought either. I spent so long thinking that I was way off base that by the time I got it working, doing what I had already tried, I wasn't sure if I really knew what I was doing. But, I worked through it all. I got it working. 

I got so many errors. Some of them repetedly. And it took me forever to learn how to read them. Like "unknown method for nil class".  I have been using this method on this class all along! How can this error be? But, I worked through it all. I got it working. 

Right now one of my hardest things to learn is how to search the web for my solutions. The answers are all there. But so often,  more senior developers speak over my head or their example isn't close enough to my situation. That part is very tough and distressing when on a timeline.

But, I will work through it all. I will get it working.

Code your imagination to life.
