IDK if I'll ever stop saying how hard it is learning to code. This post right here, is actuall very behind schedule. I have written blog post 1,3,and 4.  This one is technically number 2.

Anyway the idea is that it's tough to stay on schedule. There is sooo much information to absorb sooo fast.  It does not all sink in. I have noticed that the end of each section has a review video. I think I will start watching that video first and then go through the curriculum. I think I will understand it better as I do the lessons. The instructional video is like sitting in a classroom. Hearing the information from the instructor and watching it being done equals two times taking in the information. Then doing the lessons in their remedial introduction shouldn't be so hard. In theory. 

I have to start working on my second project tomorrow. It'll be a few weeks before I can test my theory. 

I do know that as this second project was approaching I have felt far more confident and competent. Still uneasy about the certainty of my success. But not freaking out about it as you will see in the next blog post (?) I think thats where I wrote about my freaking out.

I really don't know what I'm supposed to say in these blogs. I just know that I am supposed to do them. I am so brain mushy that writing these takes too much effort. I don't even know if these posts make any sense to the reader or if it just comes off as rambling. 

Who knows?
