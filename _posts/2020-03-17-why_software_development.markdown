That's a good question. One deserving of a good answer. At least an interesting one. When I was a younger man I used to listen to some people talk about their work history. A lot of these people would have a list of jobs/careers/skills that seemed far too extensive to be true. They weren't old enough to do all the things they say they have done. 

I became one of those people.

I have been a night janitor cleaning floors, a retail salesperson, I ran the front office of a temporary agency, a QC technician in a fiberglass plant, a furnace tech for the aforementioned plant, a Class A truck driver, new construction HVAC installer, oilfield electrician, AutoCAD operator, commercial kitchen equipment service tech, and the supervisor of prison crews in all things carpentry. Whew! That's ridiculous. I'm not even 50. 

On the hobby side of things I like to build things, sculpt things, create things. I enjoy writing, acting, and directing community theater.

In all of my hobbies and professional endeavors I do things with an artistic flair. I want things to look pretty, sound and feel beautiul, function flawlessly. I am an artist.

Now, I told you all that so I could tell you all this. As an artist I find inspiration everywhere. YouTube a lot. During my time as a kitchen equipment tech I was working with circuits, electricity, bells, whistles, lights, etc. I was really interested in LEDs as alternative lighting. I started looking at LED lighting projects and found videos of 10 x 10 LED cubes doing all kinds of fun effects. Initially I was trying to understand the circuitry. Then I caught on to the idea that these effects had to be controlled somehow. 

Enter Arduino and Raspberry Pi!   

Wow! This. Was. Life changing. I suddenly remember being 11 years old and my father bringing home our first home computer. A Tandy 2000. Radio Shack's attempt at breaking into this science fictiony new market. By today's standards a real fosil of computer technology.  If I knew how to add a pic to this I would. But you can look it up. It had a monitor that looked like a 15" b&w TV, that sat on the desktop CPU that had a built in 5.5" floppy disc drive, a seperate tape drive that looked like grandma's old Panasonic cassette player, the QWERTY keyboard, a hundred miles of cords and connectors and a library of manuals. My father was bound and determined to learn this thing called "machine language". Coding. I watched and saw all the symbols and wondered how in the world any of it made sense. I did not get it. At all.

But, now, these videos show up and I want to know how to do the same thing. I get an Arduino kit from Amazon and I get on YouTube and start finding tutorials on how to use it. All the while seeing an adevertisement pop up over and over for Flatiron school and Full Stack Development.

What? What is this and why does it keep popping up? So, I look at it and that's when it ALL clicked. The more I looked into the school and what FSD was all about I realized that I could do a whole lot more than LED cubes and a Christmas light display on my house! 

I see software development as a very powerful brush I can use to create amazing things. Things that can amaze. Things that can serve real purpose. Things that can inspire. Things that can make a difference to humanity and the planet and beyond. We are no longer living in a world outside of science fiction we exist in the matrix. Let's see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Code your imagination to life.
